<h1>An Historical Sketch of the Glenkens.*</h1>
<h2 class="byline">By Jas. Barbour</h2>
<p>About A.D. 140, when the Roman invaders arrived in Galloway, they found the country covered with wood, except the
    rocky tops of hills, or marshy swamps. There are still remains of the old forest among the hills of the Glenkens
    lying below the mossy surface—large oak trees, pine, birch and hazel, and even yet small patches of the old natural
    forest can be seen, generally along the margin of streams.</p>
<p>This woodland was stocked with various wild animals, such as deer, wild horses, cattle, swine, wolves, foxes,
    polecats, and badgers, and various smaller game. The streams abounded with fish; but few were caught and eaten by
    the natives. Many reptiles then infested the woods, and great swarms of insects, which were destroyed when the
    country was partially cleared.</p>
<p>The inhabitants were large, robust, and well-formed, of fierce and courageous tempers, and excelled in running,
    wrestling, and swimming. Their principal dress in winter was the skins of animals, previously caught in the chase,
    thrown loosely around them, and the bark of trees. They smeared their bodies with colouring matter, such as clay,
    perhaps not so much as an ornament as a protection from the bites of insects in the summer. They did not cultivate
    the soil, but fed on the milk and flesh of their flocks, what they took in hunting, and wild fruits.</p>
<p>Originally, the natives had no better shelter than thickets in the forest, dens, and caves, and the first steps
    towards improved dwellings consisted of a circle of stakes driven into the ground and wattled with brushwood.</p>
<p>The religion of the original inhabitants was Druidism, which inculcated the worship of a Supreme Being, the
    immortality of the soul, or its perpetual transmigration, the exercise of courage, and abstinence from evil.</p>
<p>The priests were selected from among the most prominent inhabitants, and were of different orders. They were accepted
    as the fittest judges in the case of disputes, and their decisions were rarely questioned. The Druids selected for
    their sacred places either the inmost recesses of the woods, or were encircled by a number of large stones, and none
    were allowed to go within that circle except the priests.</p>
<p>A specimen of this is still to be seen in Holywood in Dumfriesshire, where are the remains of a stone circle, which,
    no doubt, at one time would be situated in the midst of a thick wood, and which would give the name Holywood.</p>
<p>Another Druidical relic is a pretty large stone on the farm of Lochrennie, in the parish of Dalry, which had a hole
    through it, and was said to be used at their marriage customs—the man and woman clasping hands through the hole.</p>
<p>There are no authentic Roman remains in the Glenkens except an old road which was made from Kirkcudbright to Ayr.
    That portion from Ayr to Dalmellington has been carefully examined by a competent authority, and has been found to
    have the characteristics of a Roman road. It can still be easily traced from Dalmellington through the hills to
    Dalry, where it emerges into the present road. There are other roads to be seen, which evidently led from Dumfries
    to join the road at Dalmellington, but it is doubtful if if they are Roman.</p>
<h3>The Deil's Dyke.</h3>
<p>About A.D. 400, when the Romans retired from Galloway, the native tribes of the north
    descended from the hills and plundered the whole country. It was at this time, there is every reason to believe,
    that the inhabitants of the south-west of Scotland, with the aid of some foreign residents, raised a wall of
    protection against these rapacious visitors. This rampart, called the Roman Dyke, the Pict’s Wall, or Deil’s Dyke,
    was eight feet broad at the base and eight feet high, and seems to have been built of stone in some parts, and,
    where the soil was soft, of a mixture of stone and turf. It had a fosse on one side and, probably, a path on the
    other. The remains of this wall have been traced from the eastern shore of Loch Ryan, at Innermessan—the ancient
    Roman fort of Rorigonium—across the north of Wigtownshire and into Kirkcudbrightshire a few miles north of
    Newton-Stewart, then across the parish of Minnigaff to Garvary in the parish of Kells. Continuing in an easterly
    direction through the hills, it entered Carsphairn parish at Drumness, and crossed the river Deugh at the Tinkler’s
    Lowp, where there is a supposed British fort. It is next seen at Marskaig and Auchenshinnoch in the parish of Dalry,
    and goes on through the hills to Southmains near Sanquhar. It then took a south-easterly course down the Nith Valley
    to Hightae flow near Lochmaben. Thence it ran into the Solway Firth opposite to Bowness in Cumberland.
</p>
<p>Portions of it can still be seen. It seems to have been a very crooked line of defence.</p>
<h3>Battle on Dalarran Holm.</h3>
<p>About A.D. 800 there seems to have been no central settled government in the south of Scotland, and adventurers from
    Norway and Denmark sailed round the coast, landing occasionally and plundering and destroying what they could. On
    one occasion they penetrated into the Glenkens, where they were met by a number of the natives, when a fierce battle
    ensued. . The Danes were defeated and their sea king killed. He was buried where he fell, and a large stone still
    stands which was erected to mark the spot. </p>
<p>Pieces of swords and old iron have been turned up by the plough within the last 80
    years. It is supposed the parish of Dalry got its name from this event. The word Dalry, or Dal-righ is Gaelic, and
    signifies the King’s Valley, a level strath stretching from the battlefield along the river Ken up to the village.
</p>
<h3>Agriculture.</h3>
<p>The state of agriculture about 1300 was very rude. From appearances among the hills there Seem to have been many
    small farms over the district, and there are consequently traces of old crofts having been ploughed. It is said that
    the ploughs were very heavy and badly made, and were drawn by oxen, as many as ten having been yoked to a plough.
    They were commonly badly trained, and were managed with difficulty. The plough was unfit to penetrate the soil to
    any depth, and a man with a spade or fork had to follow, to turn over the part of the furrow which the plough should
    have done.</p>
<p>Black oats, rye, and bere (a kind of barley) constituted the crops. A bunch of thorns tied to the tail of an ox
    served the purpose of harrows, and the growing crops got little care, except protection from the cattle, for there
    were no fences. The corn was stored in barns, and when wanted for food was thrashed with flails, and parched over
    the fire in pots, and then ground in querns or hand mills.</p>
<p>About this tims kilns and mills were erected—at first on lands belonging to the king, the clergy, and some of the
    nobles— and beans, pease, and other pot herbs, began to be cultivated in gardens or low grounds belonging to the
    clergy at abbeys and convents. The hills and forests were stocked with black cattle, goats, sheep, and swine; and
    pork was the usual food of the lower classes of society.</p>
<p>The clothing of the inhabitants of the district was still very rude and simple. The skins of animals formed various
    parts of their dress. Wool, indeed, was spun into yarn by the females of the family, and woven into coarse cloth,
    which was afterwards formed into uncouth garments. Flax was sometimes grown; but linen was little used. The feet
    generally remained bare, but rude shoes, made of untanned hides, were sometimes worn.
</p>
<p>The houses of the inhabitants continued to be formed of rude materials. Both the cottagers and cattle inhabited the
    same dwelling, often with little partition between them.</p>
<p>Slavery still existed in Galloway at this time, as well as in other parts of Scotland. Slaves or bondsmen were either
    prisoners taken in war or the posterity of the vanquished. They were often bought and sold with the land on which
    they resided, but sometimes without it. Their master possessed the same right of property over their persons as he
    had over the cattle which belonged to his estate. They could not remove without his permission, and his right of
    property continued attached to them wherever they went. He could reclaim them with as much facility as he could
    seize upon the animals which had strayed from his domain.</p>
<p>The domestic employments of the inhabitants at this period were rude and simple. As artisans the men were lazy,
    awkward, and unskilful. On the women still devolved almost all the duties both of the house and the field—in short,
    every task of mean and painful drudgery.</p>
<h3>St. John’s Kirk and Clauchan of Dalry.</h3>
<p>King James IV. was sometimes sent by his confessors to do penance for his sins at the shrine of St. Ninian’s at
    Whithorn. The first pilgrimage that he made was in 1497. On his way from Edinburgh to Whithorn he passed St. John’s
    Town or Clauchan of Dalry. The Church was dedicated to St. John, and, at that time, the village was situated about a
    furlong up the hillside from the church. The river Ken flowed close past the church-yard, and on a broad pool there
    was a ferry boat.</p>
<p>In 1497 King James was at St. John’s Kirk of Dalry when he presented donations to the priest and the “puir folk,” and
    paid 5s for being ferried over the water with his retinue. James IV. often visited Whithorn about that time—he
    generally went every year— and there are records of his passing St. St. John’s Clauchan several times.</p>
<p>In 1511 James IV. gave a grant of the lands and Barony of Erliston in the parish of Dalry to Adam Hepburne, Earl of
    Bothwell, with the patronage of the Church of Dalry" in consideration of the many arduous and faithful services of
    his father, Patrick, Earl of Bothwell.” The Earls of Bothwell possessed the estate of Earlston until 1581, when it
    was forfeited by the notorious Earl of Bothwell who married Queen Mary.</p>
<p>The village of Dalry, or St. John’s Clauchan, seems to have been a place of some note in old times, as it is often
    mentioned in history. It was in the principal inn, called the Mid-town, that the quarrel between soldiers and
    inhabitants, in 1666, took place, which resulted in the battle of Rullion Green.</p>
<p>The old Church of St. John was situated down in the lower part of the churchyard, and is now converted into a tomb.
    The old holy water font is now placed close by the entrance to the present church. The tomb of the Gordons of
    Lochinvar and Kenmure is a curious old building situated close to the church.
<p>
<h3>The Forest of Buchan.</h3>
<p>There was at one time an extensive forest in the northern parts of the parishes of Kells and Minnigaff. It extended
    from Loch Doon to Loch Trool. Kells parish at that time extended to Loch Doon. There was no parish of Carsphairn
    until 1640.</p>
<p>Two farms bearing the names of Bush and Forest still mark the locality in Kells. Much of this forest was heath and
    hill pasture, with a few arable spots intervening among thickets of primeval oak, birch, and pine, with breaks of
    coppice and romantic glens, where the rowan and black and white thorns also abounded.</p>
<p>The numerous mosses, indeed, owe their formation to those ancient woods, and the trunks of trees are still dug out of
    them in a state of wonderful preservation. A remnant of the original forest can still be seen growing on Forest
    farm, and many old thorn and birch trees thinly scattered along the sides of the hills, especially near the
    banks of streams.</p>
<p>It was called the free, forest of Buchan, and, in times long ago, the Earls of Cassilis were rangers, until, in 1678,
    the care of it was given to Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar.</p>
<p>Numerous hunting lodges were scattered through the place—Hunt ha’, Garvarey, and Dukieston, were the principal ones;
    while Polmaddie is still pointed out as the place where a mill was at one time erected to prepare food for the
    hounds. The mill stood close by Polmaddie burn, and the old mill-race and weir are still clearly visible. Within a
    short distance is Castlemaddie, where the hounds were kept—Polmaddie in Gaelic signifies the burn or pool of the
    wolves or dogs. All that now remains of the name is the farm of Buchan in the parish of Minnigaff, which belongs to
    the Earl of Galloway.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century there was a dispute between the Earls of Galloway and Cassilis about the marches or
    boundary of the forest, and of this an anecdote has been recorded. “You are not to allow yourself to be talked out
    of my rights,” said Lord Galloway to his manager. “My Lord,” said the factor, “there’s nae living man can fix the
    march within twa or three thousan’ acres.”</p>
<p>Lord Cassilis’s factor took a shorter way to uphold his master’s interests. He persuaded a wabster body—a great
    oracle in the country side—who swore on his soul that a particular spot he stood upon was Lord Cassilis’s soil. His
    testimony was accepted by the arbiters in the case, and the boundary marked off. But afterwards, when partially
    intoxicated, it was said the old rascal would tell the story with a twinkle in his eye, and say—“It was true I swore
    on my soil, for that very morning I put a pickle of Lord Cassilis’s soil in the soles of my boots.”</p>
<p>The forest was stocked with large red deer, wild swine, wolves, bears, foxes, otters, wild cats, eagles, and
    ptarmigans. An extinct animal, the urus, which resembled a bull, but much larger and swifter, once ranged in the
    forest, and in Galloway, for its skull, horns, and bones have often been found in mosses and marl pits.</p>
<p>On looking back to to the discomforts of those times and to the rough customs and manners, we may be thankful we live
    in the present days of civilisation and refinement. It is possible, however, we may go too far in the indulgence of
    luxury and pleasure-seeking.</p>
