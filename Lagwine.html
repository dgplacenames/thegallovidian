<p>
  About a mile above the burgh of Carsphairn, and nearly opposite the Druidical
  circle of Daltallochan, and about a hundred yards to the right of where the
  Dalmellington road crosses the Water of Deugh, is a curious pit known locally
  as “Lagwine,” or “The Green Well of Scotland.” The word, however, does not
  mean the Green Well, but the Green Meadow, and may have been applied
  originally to the holm of Daltallochan; but now when used alone the well only
  is referred to, although the estate and the remains of the old mansion bear
  the same name.
</p>

<p>
  The Well Lagwine, is a hole about ten feet square, situated in a depression on
  the top of a rock, about fifteen feet south of the Deugh, and twenty feet
  above the surface of the stream. Its water always maintains the same level,
  and it has no outlet. It is popularly believed to be unfathomable,
  notwithstanding that thousands of cart-loads of stones have been put into it,
  but last year the presence of weeds and mud, at one side of it, would seem to
  indicate that it is bottomless no longer.
</p>

<p>
  The Green Well has never been used as a water supply, and tradition says
  nothing about when, or by whom, it was made. It looks more like the shaft of
  an old mine than anything else, only there is no trace of any mineral vein in
  the immediate vicinity, and there is no heap of excavated stone near it.
</p>

<p>
  Tradition says that when the old giant Wicht of Portmark carried off the
  treasure chest of the Romans he hid it in this well, and got the chief Druid
  of Daltallochan to place a demon at the bottom of the well to guard it, until
  at the end of a thousand years one of Wicht’s descendants should appear to
  claim it, repeating two words somewhat resembling “tarry oo,” and going
  through certain ceremonies to prove his identity.
</p>

<p>
  It was also said that Dr Dodds, the gold hunter, had thrown his dies for
  coining Spanish doubloons into it before his arrest, and that his spirit could
  not rest till they were recovered and delivered up to the government.
</p>

<p>
  Some months before the occurrences mentioned in the present story, Quentin
  M’Adam, the great laird of Lagwine, had dreamed a dream, in which old Wicht
  and Dr Dodds had appeared to him, the latter telling him that the thousand
  years had expired, and that as he was a descendant of old Wicht, he would
  instruct him how to gain possession of the treasure, on condition that he
  would promise to secure his dies and forward them to the authorities in
  Edinburgh. The laird promised, and received instructions accordingly, and
  proceeded at once to carry them out; but Quentin, notwithstanding that he was
  such a great laird, contrived in some way to bungle the ceremonies, so that
  the demon impiously refused to deliver up the pot of gold to its rightful
  owner, who then tried to bale out, and then to pump out Lagwine, but without
  success. Next he secured two divers, one of whom was torn to pieces and
  devoured by the demon, while the other came up again bleeding and torn, but
  bringing a handful of the gold-pieces up with him, and barely escap[ed] with
  his life.
</p>

<p>
  During the time the diver was staying at the Castle of Lagwine, recovering
  from the wounds, bruises, and uncomfortable sores his unfortunate carcase had
  received at the hands, or rather at the feet, of the demon of the Green Well,
  he employed his leisure time in discussing with laird M’Adam a great variety
  of projects for gaining possession of old Wicht’s treasure. The one which
  found most favour in the eyes of the laird was suggested possibly by his
  religious turn of mind, rendered more religious by a godly upbringing; and was
  founded on well known fact, that nothing in this world can prosper unless
  assisted by the all-powerful influences of Christianity and the clergy.
</p>

<p>
  Laird Quentin studied the subject deeply, and the more he studied the more
  firmly he became convinced that all his former failures resulted from his
  neglect to implore a blessing on his labours, and of using some sanctified
  means to overcome the power of the demon that had custody of the precious
  deposit. Accordingly he proposed to the diver, that as soon as the state of
  his wounds and sores would let him, he should repair to the well in company
  with the laird and the minister, whose services in any good and holy cause
  could easily be secured through the medium of an anker of brandy, clergymen in
  all ages and countries being, from their sacred calling, peculiarly
  susceptible to spiritual influences, and after the holy man had christened the
  well, and thereby weakened the power of the demon below, the diver should
  descend through the green waters, holding the open Bible in one hand and the
  rope in the other, and while keeping the evil spirit at bay with the buckler
  of the gospel, contrive to secure the rope to the cauldron, and that being
  properly fastened, dash the Bible into the open mouth of the custodian, and
  during the confusion certain to ensue from such a sudden shock of Scripture,
  cheat the devil of its due by ascending triumphantly to the regions above,
  from which vantage ground they could haul up the filthy lucre at their
  leisure.
</p>

<p>
  Laird Quentin assured the diver that there could not possibly be any danger,
  as he and the minister would weary the Lord with prayers and supplications in
  his behalf all the time he was engaged in furthering the great cause in the
  bowels of the Green Well of Scotland, and as the Scriptures tell that the
  prayer of the righteous availeth much, and the righteousness of the minister
  and the laird was beyond question, there could be no doubt what ever of the
  entire safety of the diver, with such mighty influences exerted in his behalf.
</p>

<p>
  The diver, however, was only an ignorant, prejudiced Englishman, and demurred
  to this excellent arrangement, suggesting that as the minister was the best
  hand at managing a Bible, the process of terrifying the devil would be best
  entrusted to him; the laird, being a man of great strength and agility, might
  make himself useful in securing the ropes to the pot, in the midst of the
  confusion; while he, the diver, would pray for them heartily at the top.
</p>

<p>
  Such is the selfishness of human nature, and as may be seen, of English nature
  also, which of course can scarcely be considered altogether human.
</p>

<p>
  Laird Quentin’s wise and practical project, in consequence of the selfishness
  and cowardice of a mere Englishman, had, therefore, to be abandoned, and the
  elected servant of the Lord was thus deprived of the temporal and spiritual
  blessings represented by an anker of brandy.
</p>

<p>
  When the diver was well enough to be able to walk about, he and the laird took
  an occasional stroll to the Well to see if they could devise some means of
  getting it emptied; the vain creature of an Englishman exhibiting a preference
  for what he called practical means, and impiously ridiculing any proposal to
  overcome the enchantment of the demon by religious or other appropriate
  performances; for, like most of his countrymen, he was almost an infidel,
  carrying his atheistic views even to the extent of whistling on Sundays, and
  declaring that ministers were mere mortals like other folk, and should be
  respected in accordance with their conduct only, and not on account of their
  sacred calling. As far as can now be ascertained, he seems to have belonged to
  that sect of scoffers which is known by the name of Baptists or Dippers, which
  was doubtless the reason he became a diver.
</p>

<p>
  After carefully examining the surroundings, he at length gave it as his
  opinion that the most sensible plan of emptying the Well would be to take
  advantage of its elevated position, and commence a cutting further down the
  stream where the ground was much lower, and by running a drift or even an open
  cutting into it, the laird might run off all the water, shoot the demon at the
  bottom, and carry home the treasure at his convenience, without any
  superstitious nonsense whatever.
</p>

<p>
  The more the laird studied the project and examined the place, the better he
  liked it, notwithstanding that it emanated from the brain of a mere
  Englishman; and it commended itself the more to him, as he reflected that the
  demon would in this way be deprived of his main protection—the water, and open
  to an attack by a number of people at once, all properly armed; the principal
  difficulty in the case being the trouble he might have in getting the people
  to refrain from helping themselves to the gold, even though they knew that
  laird M’Adam alone had any right to it.
</p>

<p>
  In course of time the diver departed for Portpatrick, and left the laird
  miserable in the midst of his glory, seeing that a diabolical, unearthly, and
  heathenish monster remained in undisturbed possession of the gold that the
  laird inherited from his ancestors, and with which he might have added
  considerably to his lands and heritages; and his conscience troubled him
  sorely for permitting such a state of things to continue; for even lairds have
  been known, occasionally, to have consciences.
</p>

<p>
  At length he could bear it no longer, so he mounted his steed and rode away
  across the mountains, and after a toilsome journey through a trackless
  country, came to a halt at the village of Leadhills in Lanarkshire, where he
  engaged half a dozen miners to come and assist him to over-reach the monster
  of Lagwine, or correctly speaking, to under-reach him.
</p>

<p>
  When they put in an appearance at Lagwine he conducted them to the spot and
  explained his object to them, and then left to their practical judgment the
  choice of the best place and manner of proceeding with the necessary
  operations, and they accordingly began well down the stream, and drove a level
  trench through the sand and gravel, till they came to the rock at no great
  distance from the Well. Here they had to lay down the spades and mattocks, and
  take to their drills and picks, and in a short time they had a great many
  holes made in the rock, which they filled with blasting powder, and in the
  evening they applied a light to the fuses, and producing a terrible explosion,
  detached a large amount of rock, and shattered a great deal more.
</p>

<p>
  In the morning they removed all the debris, and proceeded to drill a number of
  more holes. [sic] and when they were finished they proceeded to charge them;
  the laird remaining with them nearly all the time, and taking great interest
  in the operations.
</p>

<p>
  One of the miners had a whisky bottle to refresh him at his work, and he kept
  it in a heather bush up near the Well, and as he went for a pull at it before
  charging his holes, he chanced to look southward, and was astonished to behold
  an immense column of smoke rising from among the trees that surrounded the
  castle. He called out to the laird that something was on fire near the castle,
  and the laird ran up to look and was horrified to see his ancestral towers
  enveloped in smoke, and a dense sheet of flame rising like a pillar of fire
  from the centre of the cloud.
</p>

<p>
  “My castle’s on fire!” cries the laird, “rin an’ help tae pit it oot.” And he
  set the example and ran, followed by the miners, who saw a bright prospect of
  whisky before them, and ran like furies.
</p>

<p>
  The castle was situated in a depression in the centre of a “stron,” which juts
  out into the plain from the foot of the hills, and the sides of this “stron”
  were thickly covered with trees, while the road which wound round the base on
  the level was canopied by a cover of thick
</p>

<p>
  beeches, so that it was impossible for anyone when near the elevation
  containing the castle to see it, until the end of the projecting knowe was
  reached, and there a deep cut led up into the interior depression to the
  castle.
</p>

<p>
  When the laird and his company reached this approach they were surprised to
  see no appearance of smoke or fire about the castle, and when they came up to
  it the inmates were moving about at their accustomed duties, without the
  slightest suspicion of the danger that threatened them.
</p>

<p>
  The laird stormed and raged, and nearly jumped down the throat of his good
  lady for her carlessness, and at once proceeded to search the castle to
  ascertain the seat of the fire, but though every room was carefully examined,
  not the slightest appearance of anything of the kind was discovered; and all
  the outbuildings being carefully gone over, and no trace of fire found there
  either, Laird Quentin came to the only conclusion open to him under the
  circumstances—that the demon of the Well had taken alarm at the mining
  operations, and had adopted this method of stopping any further proceedings.
</p>

<p>
  Laird Quentin, however, was not the man to be put off in any such manner, and
  so in the morning he set off with all hands to hurry on the work, which he was
  the better encouraged to do, from the opposition of the demon clearly
  demonstrating to him that he was now on the right track, and that success was
  considered probable by that individual; and Laird Quentin had an idea that the
  superhuman being at the bottom of the Well was in the best position to know
  what plan was likely to succeed.
</p>

<p>
  Accordingly the miners set to on arrival to fill their holes with powder, but
  they found all the holes were half full of water, and the powder was
  consequently spoiled, and had to be scraped out again; and the holes kept
  leaking so unaccountably that the laird had to send all the way to Carsphairn
  for paper (a scarce article in those days), and tallow, to make waterproof
  tubes to enable them to charge the holes. This took up their time till noon,
  and after dining on the grass they began again to make the holes ready for
  blasting, but they had scarcely got begun when a tremendous [sic] shower broke
  over them and wet them to the skin, though the tallow kept the powder dry.
</p>

<p>
  Laird Quentin encouraged them to go on with the work, but they were again
  arrested by a sudden peal of thunder right over their heads, accompanied by a
  vivid flash of lightning, which made the miners run for their lives, for fear
  the lightning should explode the powder they were working with and blow them
  into fragments. In a short time the thunder-cloud moved farther south, and
  then the laird promised them a good drink of whisky, and tempted them to renew
  their endeavours to charge the holes properly. Suddenly a terrific peal
  startled them again; a thunderbolt was seen to fall from the cloud and strike
  in the direction of the castle, and in a few seconds a bright flame shot up
  against the darkened sky, followed by a volume of thick smoke. And the laird,
  who had witnessed the whole, cried out: “Rin! boys! rin! there’s nae doot
  aboot the fire this time.”
</p>

<p>
  They ran with a will, with the laird at the head of them, and when they came
  to the avenue, near the castle, the burning rafters were heard crackling in
  the fire, and the laird was in a dreadful state about it. The moment they
  turned into the cut that leads up to the castle, the crackling ceased as if by
  magic; the bright glare that had shone through the trees disappeared as soon
  as the towers were in sight, and the castle stood before them entire! the pale
  blue peat-smoke ascending in graceful wreaths from two of the chimneys, and
  the wet windows glittering in the rays of the sun, which was just breaking out
  from under the thunder-cloud. The laird couldn’t believe his own eyes, and
  didn’t, but had the building examined from top to bottom, and, as on the
  previous occasion, nothing was found to cause the smallest conflagration, and
  there was no appearance of anything having been damaged by lightning.
</p>

<p>
  It was no use going back to the Well that day, and the next was Sunday, so
  that nothing could be done, the laird being an elder, and the miners
  Cameronians, and consequently brought up in the belief that they ought neither
  to think their own thoughts nor speak their own words on that day, far less to
  work, or even to fill holes with powder; and consequently they objected to do
  this, notwithstanding that the laird—who from his high position as a pillar of
  the temple, was an authority on the subject—carefully explained to them that
  it was allowable, and was even commendable to do good on that day; and there
  could be no doubt that the defeat and discomfiture of one of the imps of Satan
  in the bottom of a bottomless pit full of water, would be a great good in the
  highest sense of that term. But dissenters of every kind are terribly
  stiff-necked and obstinate, even to the present day; and even the glory and
  aggrandisement of a great and good man like Laird Quentin, added to the
  overthrow and destruction of a demon, were insufficient to overcome their low
  miserable prejudices.
</p>

<p>
  Laird Quentin had therefore to go to the kirk, and exhibit his humility by
  lifting the half-pennies, to the glory of the good cause, and the advancement
  of Christian charity; many respectable people putting even as much as a
  sixpence into the ladle, who would not have contributed more than a half-penny
  had the ladle been in the vulgar hands of a common inn-keeper or a grocer;
  while many others put in half-pennies and pennies, that the laird might
  observe their liberality, who, if Sandy M’Millan had been at the other end of
  the ladle as usual, would have had their eyes turned up to heaven in silent
  prayer during the collection, and so inadvertently might have omitted to make
  an offering for the relief of the poor.
</p>

<p>
  When the sermon was over and the collection counted, the minister, as is the
  use and wont in such cases, repaired to the vestry to refresh his reverend
  spirit, and the laird, as a privileged person, followed him, and asked his
  sage advice respecting the terrific thunderstorms and supernatural
  conflagrations that attended any attempt to drain out the mysterious Well. The
  minister was well acquainted with the traditions respecting Lagwine, and also
  with the various appearances of fire and lightning, which were mere devices of
  the evil one, to make him desist from a work which threatened to relieve him
  of his charge; and so he informed him that the best way to overcome such
  opposition was to set aside a day in his household for fasting and prayer; to
  give of his abundance to the Lord for some pious purpose; and to take his
  family Bible to the scene of action, and the moment any of the manifestations
  of the devices of the demon were observed, to go down on his knees facing the
  north, and read aloud the Sermon on the Mount backwards, and thus force the
  demon to desist.
</p>

<p>
  In accordance with this sage advice, the laird contributed a guinea on the
  spot towards a new pulpit gown for the minister, and at once invited him over
  to the castle to superintend the family fast.
</p>

<p>
  He then went home and proclaimed a day of fasting and prayer on his estates,
  and in the morning everybody was up an hour earlier than usual to make
  preparations for celebrating the Day of Humiliation properly, in accordance
  with the manners and customs of the country.
</p>

<p>
  The best goose was killed for the laird’s dinner, and three sheep were
  slaughtered for the retainers, and a barrel of ale was brought into the
  kitchen for the refreshment of whoever chose to partake, while an anker of the
  best Manx brandy was decanted for the use of the laird and the guests of his
  own station.
</p>

<p>
  Family prayers were then conducted by the minister, who put in an early
  appearance, a grand braxy breakfast with tea was discussed, and the enjoyments
  of the Fast Day commenced in earnest. At dinner his reverence did ample
  justice to the goose, and did not forget the brandy, and in the course of the
  day entertained the whole household with prayer on four separate occasions,
  and in the evening the performances concluded with a piper and a fiddler, who
  made not only the men and maidens skip about the hall like hens on a hot
  girdle, but made the very slates rattle in concert on the roof. Evening
  prayers were then conducted by the minister, who was observed by the
  Cameronian miners to make various curiously modified transpositions of
  Scripture in the texts he introduced largely into his supplications. But the
  statements of these Cameronians would doubtless be unreliable, for they
  impiously refused to take any part in the celebration of the Fast, on account
  of some heterodox views they held, in common with dissenters generally,
  respecting the proper method of observing a Fast Day; and either sat and
  sulked in a corner, or went up and desecrated the holy day by walking up to
  Lagwine and looking at their work.
</p>

<p>
  On the morrow the laird, the miners, and one or two of the servants, went up
  to the works, and found all the cartridges they had put in the holes spoiled
  with damp, so that they had to pick them out and manufacture new ones, which
  were placed in the holes as soon as completed, and everything went on
  marvellously well; no doubt in consequence of the pious exercises they had
  been engaged in on the previous day. Some soft stones were then got, and they
  proceeded to stem down the charges, when all of a sudden a peal of thunder
  rattled above their heads as before, only this time the lightning struck the
  rock they were working on, and ran in vivid streaks among their feet,
  frightening the miners nearly to death, for fear their shots would go off and
  blow them to atoms.
</p>

<p>
  But the good laird was equal to the occasion; he called on them to stick to
  their work, for nothing would harm them; siezed [sic] the Bible and went down
  on his knees before the Well, and with face to the north began to read the
  Sermon on the Mount backwards.
</p>

<p>
  The effect was like magic; the lightning, that had been playing along the
  ground about them, instantly ceased, and the miners, reassured, returned to
  their work. Before they had given half-a-dozen blows to their stemmers,
  however, another thundering brattle rent the clouds, and a bright red flash of
  fire lighted up the darkening sky, and the next instant the thunderbolt
  descended perpendicularly and plunged into the centre of Lagwine.
</p>

<p>
  The laird jumped to his feet in an extasy of delight, waved the big Bible over
  his head, and shouted at the top of his voice—“Hurray! boys! hurray! that’ll
  hae finished the deevil!”
</p>

<p>
  What was the real reason was never known, but it is supposed that the
  interruption of his devotions restored power to the demon, and enabled him to
  put forth another effort. For, a moment after the laird had spoken, the waters
  of the Well rose in the centre like a pyramid of burning green, and out of all
  sides of it scores of horrible looking little imps issued, and rushed to and
  fro among the people, hissing and spitting most viciously. They were described
  by eye-witnesses as resembling frogs or paddocks, about a foot high, running
  about on their hind legs, only there was something in their faces that gave
  them a certain appearance of humanity; and sometimes their mouths were set in
  a sardonic grin, and at other times girned with malicious spite, their
  disgusting appearance being increased by their colour, which was a dirty
  green, and by the large white tusks which hung from the front of their upper
  jaws.
</p>

<p>
  They first attacked the laird, who had resumed his Scripture reading, jumped
  on the book and tore it with their fore claws or hands, fuffed and spat at the
  laird, and tore at his eyes, and attempted to bite his hands, and went on
  shamefully, considering the pious duty he was engaged in.
</p>

<p>
  The laird read away as well as he could, dadding them aside with his hands to
  keep them off, but they became so persistent in their annoyance that they
  raised his righteous wrath, till he seized the Bible by one of the breds and
  banged their heads with it, scattering them left like chaff in a whirlwind.
  They also attacked the miners and the laird’s servants, running among their
  feet and snapping and hanching at their legs, and making the most unearthly
  noises to frighten them. But the miners, being Cameronians, and having in
  consequence no fear of anything unearthly, laid at them with their hammers,
  and kicked them, and sent dozens of them flying in the air; but the more they
  kicked the faster new ones came from the Well, till the ground was moving with
  them; till at last some of them took advantage of the miners being occupied
  spanghuing the others, and climbed up to where they were working, and pulled
  the stemming out of the holes, and as soon as they got them out they spat into
  the holes, exploding the charges, which blew harmlessly up from the holes
  without lifting the smallest morsel of rock.
</p>

<p>
  The laird by this time had resumed his reading, and whether the Sermon on the
  Mount read backwards was too strong for them, or whether the shoes of the
  Cameronians were too heavy for them, or whether they thought they had
  accomplished their mission by pluffing out the powder, it would be difficult
  now to decide; but immediately they had pluffed off the powder they rushed in
  a swarm to the Well, clustered round the green pyramid of water, and instantly
  sank with it out of sight, utterly discomfited.
</p>

<p>
  Flushed with this glorious victory the laird gave out brandy all round, and
  then instructed the miners to charge again; but no sooner were the cartridges
  ready to be placed in the holes than a cry rose from one of the servants that
  the castle was on fire. The laird looked round and saw a dense cloud of smoke
  rising from the castle, but he was not going to let the demon deceive him with
  that scheme a third time, so he gave the miners orders to go on with their
  work, and resumed his position with the Bible on the grass and went on to read
  the Sermon backwards a second time. Then one of the servants cried out that he
  saw flames among the smoke, but the laird told him to mind his work and let
  the fames alone, while he read away more fervently than ever, so as to subdue
  the power that created the imaginary fires at the castle.
</p>

<p>
  The miners were stemming away, and the aird shouting out the Scripture at the
  top of his voice, when a messenger from the castle rushed breathless up to
  him, exclaiming—“Laird! laird! the castle’s taen lunt, an’ it’s for fair this
  time!”
</p>

<p>
  The laird declared he was lying, and said he wasn’t going to be caught three
  times in the same trap; but the man solemnly asserted that it was true, and
  the laird got up and looked, but could see no difference between the look of
  this and the former false fires. However, he saw on the road below them two
  other men running towards them, one behind the other, waving their arms and
  shouting out something, and fearing that there might be a right fire after all
  he and the miners and servants went off towards the castle to see. When they
  met the first runner he said the castle was “a’ in a bleeze,” and the second
  one said that the guidwife and the son were in an upper storey and couldn’t
  get down by the stair, and would be burnt to death.
</p>

<p>
  The laird took to his heels and ran, and the others did likewise, and on
  arrival they found the fire this time to be real; and one of the first things
  that caught the laird’s eye was the guidwife leaning out of one of the front
  windows with her infant son in her arms, and calling for help, while heavy
  volumes of smoke rolled out of the window over her head. There was no ladder
  about the place tall enough to reach the window, but the miners, being
  dissenting sinners, and consequently used to emergencies of all kinds, lashed
  two short ones together, and two old harrows to the lower end of them, and
  raising this against the wall, two of them mounted and handed down the child
  and the guidwife, whose clothes by this time were caught by the flames, and
  one of the miners had his hands badly burned trying to put them out.
</p>

<p>
  Just as the guidwife reached the ground the roof fell in with a crash, and the
  noble residence of the great M’Adams was soon reduced to a heap of ashes,
  enclosed by bare and blackened walls, and remains so even to the present day,
  the laird losing so much money and so many valuable papers and securities in
  the fire that he was unable ever to rebuild it.
</p>

<p>
  The evacuation of Lagwine Well was necessarily abandoned, the miners sent home

  vigil by laughing at the dis- comfiture of the great Laird Quentin.
