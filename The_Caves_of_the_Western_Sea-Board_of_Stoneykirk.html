            <h1>The Caves of the Western Sea-Board of Stoneykirk.</h1>
            <h2 class="byline">By Andrew Donaldson</h2>

<p>The western coast of Stoneykirk, like the whole western sea-board of the Rhinns, is of a very rocky description. In
    some places the cliffs rise to a great height, and are often quite inaccessible. Here and there at rare intervals
    are small bays with sandy or shingly beaches. The largest of these are Port-o’-Spittal, and proceeding southward,
    Port-a-Yew, Cairnganoch, Float, Ardwell, and Drumbreddan Bays. From Baygill, where the shore of Kirkmaiden starts,
    northwards to the Pans the cliffs are grassy, though steep and of great height, and make a pleasant walk on a fine
    day, although in stormy weather it is much the opposite. There is a wide fringe of jagged rocks between the bottom
    of the cliffs and low-water, and any vessel unfortunate enough to get ashore has very little chance of ever getting
    off again. Northward of the Pans the cliffs are rocky, and at many places the sea never recedes from their base.
    There caves are numerous and various, differing in dimensions, and nearly all of them have some associations of some
    kind or other, or some natural peculiarity. Near Baygill, but in Kirkmaiden, is Port-Lochan, so called from a lochan
    which the tide leaves in a basin of the rocks. On one occasion a large number of the fish known as blockans were
    left by the tide in this lochan, and became an easy prize for the first comer.</p>

<p>Between Drumbreddan Bay and Ardwell Bay is the site of the Castle of the Doon. It is situated on the top of the rocks
    almost, and from the fact of there having been a stairway leading down to the shore it is presumed that it is one of
    the many forts built along the coast of Galloway by Magnus King of Norway, who effected a landing in 1098, and
    sorely oppressed the Galwegians. A more suitable site for a wide range of sea view, up as well as down channel,
    could not have been selected, and gives additional proof to the presumption that it was erected by men who were as
    much at home on the sea as on the land. Round Ardwell Point is Ardwell Bay, with a large extent of sandy beach, and
    was a famous landing place of contraband goods in the old smuggling days.</p>

<p>There can be no greater contrast than Adrwell Bay on a fine day in summer, with the sea glittering in the sun and the
    incoming tide creeping lazily over the yellow sand, and the same spot when lashed with a north-wester in early
    spring, the waves running mountain-high and breaking on the shore in clouds of snow-white foam. Ardwell Bay is
    surrounded by grassy cliffs, which in summer are adorned with the wild flowers partial to the selection of such
    situations. A little to the north of Ardwell Bay is what is known as the Red Co’. It is situated half way up the
    face of a grassy cliff, and is easy of access. It is very dry, and is occasionally occupied by a casual tenant. Not
    far off the Red Co’ there is, or rather was, the grave of a man whose body came in with the sea, and was buried
    close to the spot where the body came ashore. The grave was marked with a stone at the head and another at the foot,
    but a number of years ago a landslip of a portion of the cliff immediately above occurred and completely covered the
    grave and the marks.</p>

<p>Further along towards the Pans (so-called because at one time there was here pans for evaporating salt from
    sea-water) there is the Sheeps’ Rink Co’, which has been the residence for some years of William Purves, who at one
    time used to travel with itinerant circuses as a clown, an occupation which his father followed before him. After
    leaving the circus, he travelled the country providing a variety entertainment himself, for which he was granted the
    use of all the country smithies in the district. This modern cave-dweller now quietly passes his life peddling small
    wares and picture post-cards of himself, and going messages for the people of the district. Improving on Nature’s
    work, he has made his rocky dwelling pretty comfortable by putting on a door and adding some articles of furniture.
    He has many visitors during summer, and keeps a book in which all are requested to enter their names.</p>

<p>Between Sheeps’ Rink Co’ and Pan Cottage is what is known as the Dripping Co’ from the circumstance that there is a
    continual drip of water from the rocks above the entrance. This cave has a wide entrance, and runs a long way into
    the rock. Not far in from its mouth the cave takes a bend, and the explorer is immediately plunged in utter
    darkness. A considerable distance in there is a wall built across, but for what purpose is not known, unless it has
    been intended to keep the cattle that graze along the shore from going so far in as to prevent their return to
    daylight. Pan Cottage stands close beside in a romantic situation, with one of its gables built against a large
    rock, the higher rocks behind protecting it from the sea breeze, and the high cliffs prevent the bitter winds of the
    north and east from coming near it. Owing to its sheltered situation, and to its lying well to the sun, flowers of
    all kinds bloom in great profusion, and in summer, with its romantic natural surroundings, it forms a veritable
    oasis in the midst of a primitive confusion of cliff and rock.</p>

<p>A short distance northward of Pan Cottage is Sir Gothray’s Co’, which was for some time the hiding-place of Sir
    Godfrey M’Culloch when outlawed for the murder of Cardoness and many other crimes. He was ultimately taken captive
    and executed at Edinburgh in 1697. Those who are curious in such matters and would care for further details
    regarding Sir Gothray are referred to the Spring Number of the Gallovidian for 1908. The cave was at the time (1908)
    difficult to find, and difficult to access when found, but some few months ago a landslip occurred, blocking up the
    old entrance. But it can now be entered more easily from above, and whenonce inside it is roomy, with a fine dry
    sandy floor.</p>

<p>Still passing in a northerly direction, the Ham Co’ is found near a natural archway in a projecting buttress of rock
    known as the “Holed Stane.” The Ham Co’ is so-called because the water that percolates through the roof and runs
    down the sides, forming stalactites not unlike rolls of bacon. On the top of the cliff, immediately before reaching
    Float Bay, is the remains of a “work” of some kind, known locally as “Kenmure Graves.” A triple trench is clearly
    defined on the landward side, but on the seaward side all traces of the trench, if any ever existed, has altogether
    disappeared.</p>

<p>Float Bay is one of the largest of the few bays that break this rugged coast-line, and was sometimes used as a
    landing-place by the smugglers, the article chiefly landed here being salt, brought over from Carrickfergus, in
    Ireland. There is a large cave inside the bay, on the north side, known as the Craw Co’, and it has been tenanted
    for some considerable time by a man and his wife. The man is a bricklayer to trade, but increasing years and
    infirmities threw him out of the race, and now he dwells in a house of Nature’s making, which he has rendered more
    habitable by putting on a door. His wife does washing and sewing for some of the people in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Outside Float Bay, and to the north a short distance, is the Auld Wife’s Co’. It is almost impossible to reach this
    cave from the landward side, and altogether impossible from the sea at high-water. When the tide is out, however,
    there is a wide opening in the rocks with a shingly bottom, and at the end of this opening is the cave. There is a
    very fine echo in this cave, which was taken notice of by Chalmers in his great work Caledonia. It was also
    frequently used as a hiding place by the smugglers, as in fine weather they could beach their boat in the opening
    already mentioned and disembark their goods undisturbed.</p>

<p>Still going northwards the next cave is known locally as Jelly Co’, but for what reason is not now known. It is
    remarkable for a large block of conglomerate rock of the kind known as pudding stone.</p>

<p>Ann’s Co’, on the shore of Float Fell, is a very large cave, and is close to the Money Head, where tradition has it
    that one of the ships of the Great Armada of 1588 was wrecked when endeavouring to return to Spain after a
    tempestuous voyage round the north of Scotland. *Inside Cairnganoch Bay on its north side is the Red Co’, which is
    at present inhabited by an Englishman, who for some time lived in the Red Co’, near Ardwell Bay. He finds occasional
    work as a farm labourer. Still proceeding north there are the Sheep’s Co’, and Beardie’s Co’, but why so named there
    is nothing to tell. These two last-named exhausts the enumeration of the caves on this coast of Stoneykirk, but
    there are many small inlets besides the larger bays already mentioned. These all have names, but there is nothing of
    any note connected with them.</p>

<p>No sketch of this coast would be complete without noticing the North and South Kemp on the shore if Kirlauchlan Farm.
    There is a tradition that the Norsemen made two determined attempts to land here, and were beaten off with great
    slaughter on both occasions. The very name of the place goes far to indicate such conjecture, as “kempe” is good
    Norse for Warrior, and although according to tradition the Norsemen were defeated, they must ultimately have
    attained their object, as Kirlauchlan is one of the place-names where the Norsemen have left their mark, as the
    definition is Caer Lochlin, the fort of the Norsemen.</p>
