            <h1>Gallawa Superstitions.</h1>
            <h2 class = "subtitle">No.VII—The Dunnie.</h2>

            <h2 class = "byline">By R. De Bruce Trotter</h2>
            
<p>
  There are four prominent supernatural personages common to the superstitious
  beliefs of our Alban and Gaelic ancestors — the Each-Uisgé, or Water-Horse,
  the Kelpie, the Broonie, and the Doonie — all of which have something in
  common, and all of which are distinctly different, and the tales current about
  them are far removed from probability, or even possibility, so that it is
  difficult to imagine how they have obtained such a wide-spread credence. They
  may probably have been some of the numerous gods of our heathen ancestors,
  transformed into evil spirits by the primitive saints by whom our Christianity
  was introduced, and who, finding they could not otherwise overcome the awe and
  reverence in which they were held by the natives, and that they could not
  easily adopt them as Christian saints, as the early Romish Church did with
  Jupiter, Venus, Woden, and Œster, they denounced them as demons and attributed
  to them the evil qualities likely to make them hateful to their former
  worshippers.
</p>

<p>
  The first-named of these, Each-Uisgé, the Water-Horse, is very little known in
  Galloway now, but he is still believed in as an existent reality in great part
  of the West Higblands (where I have spoken to people who professed to have
  seen it), in the Isle of Man, in the norh-west [sic] of Ireland, and in Wales.
  It was or malevolent disposition, and frequented the lone end of Loch Ken till
  the establishment of thee Boat of Rhone; and several other lochs, but scarcely
  ever heard of now.
</p>

<p>
  The Kelpie was also a water-spirit, and was also malevolent, and frequented
  big burns, rivers, and lochs; and under the form of a horse or a cow, or a
  young girl or a young man, laid itself out to lure people to destruction by
  drowning, in order, it is said, that they might be utilised as sacrifices to
  the devil. The Kelpie is not by any means extinct in Galloway yet.
</p>

<p>
  The Broonie or Brownie is, I fear, extinct now, though he was still believed
  in as an existing entity as late as 1820, in Galloway at any rate. Wull
  Nicholson’s immortal poem, “The Brownie of Blednoch,” and Hogg’s well-known
  tale, “The Brownie of Bodsbeck,” have made him familiar to most people. Hogg,
  Sir Walter Scott, and other writers of that type have tried hard to make out
  that the Broonie was a role assumed for protection and safety by the fugitive
  Covenanters when our godly sovereigns Charles II. and James VII., assisted by
  the Scottish Episcopal clergy and nobility, were striving to convert them from
  Christianity to Episcopacy by means of the thumb-screws, the boot, the Bass
  Rock, the sword, the carbine, and the gallows, and other gentle arts of pious
  persuasion.
</p>

<p>
  This solution of the mystery of the Broonie is nullified by the fact that the
  Broonie is not a recent creation, and is not confined to Lowland Scotland, but
  has been known to all the Gaelic races for hundreds, and probably for
  thousands of years. In the Scottish Highlands and in Ireland he is widely
  known as “The Gruagach,” which means “the hairy one,” reminding one of
  Nicholson’s description:
</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">On his hairy form there was naething seen</div>
    <div class="verse">But a philabag o’ the rashes green,</div>
    <div class="verse">While his gnairled knees played aye knoit between—</div>
    <div class="verse">What a sicht was Aiken Drum.</div>
    <div class="verse">On his wauchy airms three claws did meet</div>
    <div class="verse">As they trailed on the grun by his taeless feet—&c.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  This is an exact description of the Gruagach all but the kilt, which Nicholson
  probably put on for decency’s sake. His other characteristics are just as
  described by Nicholson.
</p>

<p>
  He is also well known in the Isle of Man as the Glashan, probably in reference
  to his grey-brown colour. In Carrick he was formerly known as The Bodach, or
  old man, but he is now known there as the Broonie. In all places he is
  described as kind, helpful, industrious, and obliging; nocturnal in his
  habits, fond of cream and new milk, and of the heat of a fire, which he never
  replenishes of his own accord, but “he’s awfu’ easy huff’t.” He never assumes
  any shape but his own.
</p>

<p>
  The Dunnie or Doonie is now almost as scarce as the water-horse, though I knew
  a man in Nithsdale in 1855 who declared that one of them did signal service
  when he made his appearance into the world.
</p>

<p>
  He seems to be a Danish version of the Broonie, and is still talked about from
  Nithsdale through the Border Counties and even in Northumberland. He sometimes
  assumes the appearance of an old man or woman, and sometimes of a horse, and,
  like the Broonie, he is always disposed to give help to people in need of
  assistance. His name is probably derived from the Gaelic Donn (brown), and
  would consequently mean Brownie; Donn, pronounced Dun or Thun, being the
  origin of the English word “Dun” and the Scotch word “Din,” meaning a lightish
  brown. He has, in his character of an old man, probably some connection with
  the Bodach of Carrick, pronounced Budach or Buddich, whence come the Scotch
  Buddy, and the English Body — a person or individual.
</p>

<p>
  According to the account of Douglas M’Math, his father was a herd on the farm
  of Locherben, in the parish of Closeburn, and lived in a little sheiling on
  the march of Mitchellslacks, long since destroyed, and he had been away on the
  hill all the afternoon, and it was long after dark when he got home, for the
  weather was very coarse and threatening an “onfa’,” for it was the 22nd of
  December and the weather awfully broken. When he got home he found the wife in
  the pains of labour, and the only woman that could be had was Lucky Harkness,
  of The Garroch, and she was very shortly married herself, and so was of little
  or no use; so there was nothing for it but to order M’Math off as hard as he
  could go to Thornhill for the doctor. Thornhill was a very small place then,
  and only one doctor in it. M’Math was awfully tired, so he went down to the
  farm town to get the beast, but “the Cork” had another farm the other side of
  Durisdeer, somewhere near Coshogle, and he had the beast away there and would
  not be back till’ the next day; so that there was nothing for the poor man but
  to trudge away over the muir, footsore, wornout, and weary, all the way to
  Thornhill, with the dread possibility of finding the doctor not at home, but
  away seven or eight miles off in some other direction.
</p>

<p>
  Not far off there is a large shallow circular hole in the meadow, some 12 or
  14 feet across, from which a strong stream of about eight feet wide rises
  suddenly with tremendous force, making a large and well-filled burn, even in
  the driest seasons. It is said that this well was long an object of worship to
  the ancient inhabitants of the district, and was the cause of frequent wars
  and contentions for its possession between the natives of Nithsdale and
  Annandale. This is borne out to some extent by the numerous large and almost
  perfect cairns, and very plentiful small cairns, still existing for miles to
  the south of it.
</p>

<p>
  It would be of great antiquarian interest to have this “Well” thoroughly
  explored, as such places were usually the receptacles of many votive
  offerings; and this one might yield some valuable relics. It is the property
  of the Duke of Buccleuch.
</p>

<p>
  When M’Math was turning the head of this pool in the dark he ran up against a
  pony standing right in his way, and instead of letting fling at him, as he
  expected, it rubbed its face up against his shoulder. He took hold of it he
  the forelock and tried to lead it towards the “toun,” so that he might get a
  saddle and bridle, or at least a halter to ride it into Thornhill with.
</p>

<p>
  He couldn’t imagine what a pony could be doing there, or whose it was, unless
  some tinklers might be camping near by, and he hadn’t seen or heard of any.
  Whoever it belonged to it was a perfect God-send, and he determined not to let
  the chance slip; so as it would not be led towards the stable, he jumped on
  its back and tried to direct it towards the stable with his stick; but no! He
  was no sooner on its back than it wheeled about and set off in the direction
  of Thornhill at a smart “trootle.” At first he was in great dread, thinking it
  was some malicious kelpie, which was taking him to drown him in the “Well” to
  become a sacrifice to the devil, but a few minutes were sufficient to assure
  him that such was not the case; for the way the wind blew against his face
  soon told him that his mysterious charger was heading right for Cample Brig.
  So on it “trootled,” M’Math jogging away the best way he could, without either
  saddle or bridle; at first trying to direct it with the stick; but he soon
  found that it wouldn’t be directed by him, and knew a way better than he did,
  and would go neither faster nor slower by any effort of his. So had just to
  let it have its own way, when in due time it got to Thornhill and ” trootled”
  right up to the doctor’s door, where it came to a dead stop. When M’Math
  dismounted and knocked at the door the pony disappeared, and when the doctor
  came he declared that he was that tired that he couldn’t go without a horse,
  and both of his animals were completely exhausted.
</p>

<p>
  So M’Math and he knocked up the only two other people in the place who had a
  horse, to try to get the loan of one, but neither of them would lend one for
  love or money, and he and the doctor had just to go back disappointed, and
  wondering what on earth was to be done.
</p>

<p>
  Just as they turned the doctor’s corner he ran up against the same old pony,
  standing as if it was asleep. “Thank goodness!” says the doctor, “here’s
  somebody’s aul’ yaud; l’Il just take it with me and ask no questions,” and he
  tried to lead it towards the stable, but not a foot would it move. “Bring out
  the saddle and bridle, says he, “and we’ll put them on here, and the saddle
  and bridle were brought out, but it would have none of them, and after M’Math
  telling him that it had brought him in without either, he got on to its back,
  and the moment he did so it “ trootled ” away with him in the proper
  direction. The doctor was astonished at the wonderful sagacity of the brute,
  which carried him safely, “ower muir and fell,” and right up to M’Math’s door,
  where the doctor on alighting was able to tell by the sounds emanating from
  the sheiling that he was just in time to afford valuable assistance; for in
  little more than half-an-hour a man child was born into the world.
</p>

<p>
  Murdoch M’Math set out for home in the wake of the doctor, but could not
  overtake him, and nearly lost himself seven or eight times on the way. At long
  and last he came to the big well, and there stood the pony just where he had
  found it, and apparently fast asleep. He clapped it on the neck, and said to
  it, “ Wha’s ever aught ye, ye did my wife and me a gude turn this nicht. I hae
  juist gotten in some corn for the hens, an’ l’Il bring ye doon the best feed
  o’ corn ye ever had in your life an’ anither in the mornin’.”
</p>

<p>
  When he got to the house and found the wife better he was like to stand on his
  head with joy, and got an immense feed of corn and took it down to the well,
  but when he got there no pony could be found. He made up a bed for the doctor
  and made him stay all night, and in the morning he went out again to feed the
  pony, but neither it nor any tinklers or other wanderers could be found.
  Mitchellslacks came home unexpectedly in the morning, for he was anxious about
  the sheep, and he drove the doctor home, and being told the adventure of the
  pony, informed the doctor that it had been the Doonie, a well-known
  institution thereabouts, which had helped many a one in a strait, and he
  reckoned would do so many a time again. “Aye !” says he, “I mind my faither
  tellin’ us, yt when he was a laddie at the skule, he gaed tae Closeburn
  Academy; an’ yae afternune him an’ some ither boys gaed tae Crichope Linn
  looking for young doos, for there was a hantle o’ them biggit there then. Ye
  ken what a queer bit Crichope is; joost like a muckle crack in the freestane
  rock, a’ thrawn an’ crookit, wi’ bits o’ shelfs here an’ there, an’ holes yt
  the doos biggit in, an’ a’ smooth’t wi’ the water, yt wus rinnin’ at the
  buddum, maybe therty or forty fit doon. Weel, he was thrang herryin’ a nest,
  an’ pittin’ the young doos in his jacket pouch, when his fit slippit an’ ower
  he gaed; an’ juist as he was gaun oot o’ sicht, he gat a grip o’ a hazel buss,
  an’ hel’ on. He try’t a’ he could tae warsel up on tae the shelf again, but he
  couldna manage’t, an’ it wasna lang or he fun yt he couldna hing on muckle
  langer; an’ he was juist lookin’ doon tae see if he wus gaun tae fa’ on tae a
  craig an’ get kill’t, or intae a pule an’ get droon’t; whun he notice’t a
  queer-lookin’ aul’ wife stannin’ on a shelf naur the buddum, Whun she saw him
  lookin’ she hel’ oot her brat wi’ baith han’s, an’ cry’t oot — ‘Let gae, an’
  A’ll kep ye.’ He didna think there was muckle chance o’ her keppin’ him, but
  he had tae let gae onyway, an’ doon he fell on tae the aul’ wifes apron. The
  apron didna exactly kep him though, for he skeytit off’t, an’ intae a deep
  pule, yt couldna be seen fae abune; an’ the minute he cam’ tae the tap the
  aul’ wife gruppit him by the cuff o’ the neck an’ harl’t him oot on tae the
  stanes, no’ a bit the waur.
</p>

<p>
  “He couldna imagine hoo the aul’ wife got there, or hoo they wur gaun tae wun
  oot; for the linn’s a bit naebuddy can wun either oot or in o’; but she took
  him by the han’ and said, ‘C’wa this wey; an’ she led him oot o’ the inn by a
  wey he kent naething aboot, an’ could never fin’ efter, for he socht for’t
  aften; and then she said, ‘Noo, scrieve for hame, au dinna ye come here
  herryin’ doos again, or maybe the Doonie ’ll no be here tae kep ye, an’ when
  he turn’t roon tae answer her she wusna there. Sae ye see, doctor, there’s
  waur things nor the Doonie i’ warl’.”
</p>

<p>
  It is not likely that the farmer in Mitchellslacks now could understand
  Scotch, far less speak it, but the farmers in those days had not discovered
  what a disgrace it was not to be English, or what an awful crime it was,
  socially, to be able speak more than one language.
