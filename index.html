        <p>
          <em>The Gallovidian: An Illustrated Southern Counties Magazine</em>
          (1899 - 1949) is a treasure trove of local hisotry, folklore and
          literature. It was published quarterly until 1919 and from 1920 as
          <em>The Gallovidian Annual</em>. There were no publications in
          1916-1918 and 1943-1948.

          As copies are hard to find, I have begun digitising the text of the
          magazine. I have attempted to ensure that the texts hosted here
          have fallen into the public domain. Please let me know if any are
          still within copyright.
